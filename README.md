# cubetimer
Yet another rubiks cube timer. 

I need one that tracks how long to different states of solved I am spending so I know where to improve. 

Real reason is to start a new project and try out some project management stuff developer type stuff.

## Things I hope to get better at
* Test Driven Development
* Microservices
* PyGame
* UI/UX - specifically design
